        <b>Mahatma Gandhi <em>(born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi)</em></b>
        was an Indian lawyer,<br>
        <strong>politician, social activist,</strong> and writer who became the leader of the Indian
        <mark>Independence Movement against
            British rule.</mark> As such, he came to be considered the <u>father of his country.</u> Gandhi is
        internationally esteemed
        for his doctrine of nonviolent protest <mark>(satyagraha)</mark> to achieve political and social progress.<br />

        <q> In the eyes </q>of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
        adoration
        of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could
        hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the
        Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma
        Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth. <br />

    Gandhi was the <u>youngest child of his father’s fourth wife.</u> His <u>father—Karamchand Gandhi,who was the dewan
        (chief minister) of Porbandar,</u> the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat
    state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able
    administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects, and
    the headstrong British political officers in power.<br />

    <strong>Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion,</strong> did not care much for finery or
    jewelry, divided
    her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and nights of nursing
    whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the
    Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are
    nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted ahimsa
    (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between
    adherents of various creeds and sects. <br />

    The educational facilities at Porbandar were rudimentary; in the <u>primary school that Mohandas attended,</u> the
    children wrote the alphabet in the dust with their fingers. Luckily for him, his father became dewan of Rajkot,
    another princely state. Though Mohandas occasionally won prizes and <s>scholarships at the local schools,</s> his
    record was on the whole mediocre. One of the terminal reports rated him as “good at English, fair in Arithmetic
    and weak in Geography; conduct very good, bad handwriting.” <mark>He was married at the age of 13 </mark>and thus
    lost a year
    at school. A diffident child, he shone neither in the classroom nor on the playing field. He loved to go out on
    long solitary walks when he was not nursing his by then ailing father (who died soon thereafter) or helping his
    mother with her household chores.

    <h3><mark>Years in South Africa</mark></h3>
    <hr/>
    <br/>
    <u>Africa was to present to Gandhi challenges and opportunities </u>that he could hardly have conceived. In the end he
    would spend more than two decades there, returning to India only briefly in <b><mark>1896–97.</mark></b> The youngest two of his four
    children were born there.
