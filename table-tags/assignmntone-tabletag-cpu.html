            <td>A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mobo, base board, system board, or, in
                Apple computers, logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and
                other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic
                components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors
                for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such
                as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and
                other components integrated for general use.</td>

            <td>Computer data storage or digital data storage is a technology consisting of computer components and
                recording media that are used to retain digital data. It is a core function and fundamental component of
                computers.The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing
                computations. In
                practice, almost all computers use a storage hierarchy,[1]: 468–473  which puts fast but expensive and
                small storage options close to the CPU and slower but less expensive and larger options further away.
                Generally, the fast[a] technologies are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies
                are referred to as "storage".
                Even the first computer designs, Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and Percy Ludgate's Analytical
                Machine, clearly distinguished between processing and memory (Babbage stored numbers as rotations of
                gears, while Ludgate stored numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles). </td>

            <td>In computer architecture, a bus (historically also called a data highway[1] or databus) is a
                communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers.[2]
                It encompasses both hardware (e.g., wires, optical fiber) and software, including communication
                protocols.[3] At its core, a bus is a shared physical pathway, typically composed of wires, traces on a
                circuit board, or busbars, that allows multiple devices to communicate. To prevent conflicts and ensure
                orderly data exchange, buses rely on a communication protocol to manage which device can transmit data
                at a given time.

            <td>A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor.[1] Registers
                usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware
                functions, and may be read-only or write-only. In computer architecture, registers are typically
                addressed by mechanisms other than main memory, but may in some cases be assigned a memory address e.g.
                DEC PDP-10, ICT 1900.[2]

                Almost all computers, whether load/store architecture or not, load items of data from a larger memory
                into registers where they are used for arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and other operations,
                and are manipulated or tested by machine instructions. Manipulated items are then often stored back to
                main memory, either by the same instruction or by a subsequent one. Modern processors use either static
                or dynamic random-access memory (RAM) as main memory, with the latter usually accessed via one or more
                cache levels.</td>

                to draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside and move air across a heat
                sink to cool a particular component. Both axial and sometimes centrifugal (blower/squirrel-cage) fans
                are used in computers. Computer fans commonly come in standard sizes, such as 92 mm, 120 mm (most
                common), 140 mm, and even 200–220 mm. Computer fans are powered and controlled using 3-pin or 4-pin fan
                connectors.

                allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical
                location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as
                hard disks and magnetic tape), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly
                depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as
                media rotation speeds and arm movement.</td>

                embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. After
                their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly
                parallel problems due to their parallel structure. GPUs ability to perform vast numbers of calculations
                rapidly has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where it
                excels at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include

                supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others
                automatically adapt to the main voltage.

                Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to the ATX specification, which includes
                form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it
                always provides a 5-volt standby (5VSB) power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain
                peripherals are powered.</td>

                optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, while other drives can both read and
                record. Those drives are called burners or writers since they physically burn the data onto on the
                discs. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and
                recorded by such drives.

                Although most laptop manufacturers no longer have optical drives bundled with their products, external

                Sound functionality can also be integrated into the motherboard, using components similar to those found
                on plug-in cards. The integrated sound system is often still referred to as a sound card. Sound
                processing hardware is also present on modern video cards with HDMI to output sound along with the video

                A southbridge chipset handles functions such as USB, audio, the system firmware, the lower speed
                PCI/PCIe buses, the IOAPIC interrupt controller, the SATA storage, the historical PATA storage, the NVMe
                storage, and low speed buses such as ISA, LPC, SPI, and/or eSPI.[1][2] Different combinations of
