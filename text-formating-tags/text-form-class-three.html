    ndia recorded identical <mark>3–1 victory</mark> over West Indies
    and Sri Lanka in early 2007 with <b><i>Dhoni averaging in excess of 100 in both the series.</i></b> Subsequently,
    Dhoni was part
    of the squad for 2007 Cricket World Cup in which India<u> unexpectedly crashed</u> out in the group stage after
    losses to
    Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with <mark>Dhoni scoring ducks in both these matches and just 29 runs in the
        tournament.</mark>
    As a result, Dhoni's house in Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by activists of JMM and security was tightened for
    his family.[58]<mark> Dhoni scored 91* against Bangladesh in the first match of the ODI series in May 2007</mark>
    which fetched
    the Man of the Match award while also later winning the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was
    washed away.[59] <u>Dhoni played for ACC Asia XI cricket team in the Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in three
        matches <br />
        at an average of 87 including 139 off 97 balls in the third ODI.[60]</u> <br />
    <u>Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the 2007 Future Cup against South Africa in Ireland</u> and the
    subsequent seven-match series against England.[61] <q>Dhoni was awarded an 'A' grade contract by BCCI in June
        2007</q>.[62]
    Dhoni was appointed as the <b>captain of the Indian squad for the inaugural World Twenty20 in September
        2007.</b>[63] Dhoni
    led India to <mark>victory in the tournament after defeating Pakistan in the final.</mark>[64][65] Dhoni was
    appointed as the
    captain of Indian cricket team in all formats later.[66]<br />

    Dhoni equaled Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in
    ODI by effecting six dismissals against England.[67] Dhoni took his first and only wicket in international cricket
    on 30 September 2009 when he bowled Travis Dowlin of West Indies in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy.[68] However, he
    scored just three runs in the only match he batted with India crashing out of the series in the group stage after
    the match against Australia was washed out.[69] Dhoni averaged more than 60 in the 2008-09 season.[70] Dhoni scored
    two centuries during Sri Lanka's tour of India in November 2009 which India won to achieve the top ranking in ICC
    test ranking for the first time in its history.[71] Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs
    in just 24 innings, at an average of 70.43 and topped the ICC ODI batsman rankings for several months.[72]
    <b><mark>He was

    <h4><mark><b>2011 WORLD CUP WINNER </b></mark></h4>
    <hr /> <br />
    <mark>Dhoni led the Indian squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by India.</mark>[74] India won its second
    ever ODI
    world cup after defeating Sri Lanka in the final with <b>Dhoni being named man of the match for scoring an unbeaten
        91.</b>[75] In December 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years and
    Dhoni
    top-scored in all the three matches of the series with a century in the first ODI at Chennai.[76] Dhoni led India to
    victory in the <mark><b><em>2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the first and the only captain in international
                cricket to claim
                all ICC limited overs trophies.</em></b></mark> In the rain-shortened final against England, India won
    by five runs on DLS method
    though Dhoni himself was out for a duck.[77] He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the
    Tournament' by the ICC.[78]

    Dhoni batting against South Africa during the group stage match of 2013 ICC Champions Trophy
    After the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against the hosts and Sri
    Lanka.[79] Dhoni got injured at the start of the tournament thus ruling him out for most of the tournament and
    returned to play the final where he was adjudged Man of the match for scoring 45 runs off 52 balls including 16 runs
    in the final cricket to take India to victory by one wicket.[80] In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India
    batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate more than thousand runs in ODIs against Australia.[81] India toured
    South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013–14 season. Though Dhoni scored 84 runs at an average of 48 including one
    half-century against South Africa and 272 runs with three consecutive 50-plus scores against New Zealand, India lost
    both the series.[45] Dhoni himself reached 8000 runs in ODI in the series against New Zealand.[82] Dhoni led India
    in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 where India finished as runners-up after losing to Sri Lanka in the final.[83] He was
    named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[84]
    <br />
    India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 and series against West Indies in India where Dhoni scored 146 runs
    across the five innings he batted.<br />

    <h4><mark><b> TEST RETIREMENT AND 2015 WORLD CUP </b></mark></h4>
    <hr />
    <q>Dhoni played his last series during India's tour of Australia in December 2014.</q> Following the third
    Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format.[86] In his last test, he effected
    nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara's record
    for most stumpings in international cricket and also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a
    match by an Indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018.[87][88] In the Carlton
    Mid triangular series in Australia, India failed to win a single match with Dhoni himself managing just
    70 runs from three innings at an average of 23.34. <br />

    During the <strong>2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage
        matches</strong>
    in a world cup.[90] In the match against Zimbabwe at Auckland, he made 85 which was the highest score by
    an Indian captain in New Zealand. After beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third
    overall and the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches.[91] India lost to eventual
    champions Australia in the semi-finals with Dhoni having a good series, scoring 237 runs in six innings
    at an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of 102.15 and thus, became only the second Indian captain to
    have an average over 50 and strike rate over 100 in a particular season of the World
    Cup.,<br />
