    <h3> THE FATHER OF NATION <mark> MOHANDAS KARMCHAND GANDHI </h3>
    (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) </mark>was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist
    who
    employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for <b>India's independence</b> from British rule. He
    inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning
    great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in <u>South Africa in 1914</u>, is now used throughout the
    world.[3]

    Born and raised in a<mark> <q>Hindu family in coastal Gujarat,</q></mark>
    <blockquote>Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and
        was called to the bar at the age of 22. </blockquote>two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start
    a
    successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went
    on to live in <s>South Africa </s> <br /><br />
    for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
    resistance in a
    campaign for civil rights. In <strong>1915, aged 45,</strong> he returned to India and soon set about <em>organising
        peasants, farmers,
        and urban labourers</em> to protest against discrimination and <mark>excessive land tax.</mark></p>
    <p>Assuming leadership of the <b> <u> <mark> Indian National Congress in 1921,</mark></u></b> Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty,
        expanding <mark> <q> women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity,</q></mark> ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving
        <u>swaraj or self-rule</u>. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with
        India's rural poor. <u>He began to live in a self-sufficient residential</u> community, to eat simple food, and
        undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism
        to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi)
        <strong><q> Dandi Salt March in 1930</q></strong> and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and
        for many years in both South Africa and India.
